The popularity of many social network sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTubeâ€¦ creates a huge demand of managing and querying visual data from billions of images. Searching by text cannot describe the information as effective as by images but it is more complicated to search by images due to the changes of camera angles or lighting conditions. To address this problem, the authors conduct a comparison of the retrieval quality between a standard Bag-of-Words model and one with spatial reranking using RANSAC. Our experimental results on Oxford Building 5K Dataset show that spatial reranking improves the mean Average Precision of Bag-of-Words model from 0.676 up to 0.741. The authors view this work as a promising step to further improve the performance of different visual search systems using the spatial relations between the images.
