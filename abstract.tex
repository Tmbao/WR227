Emotional and memorable moments are usually kept and shared on different online services such as Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, and Google Photos. As a result, one of users' pratical need is to have their photos automatically annotated. This motivates us to propose a system that can suggest personalized annotations for each uploaded photo to online services. Our system provides 2 major features. First, automatically recommend personalized annotations for newly uploaded photos based on visually similar uploaded photos in the past. Second, propagate manually annotations of users to other similar photos existed in their albums. To evaluate the performance of our system, we use the Oxford 5K Building Dataset and a dataset consisting of our personal photos on Facebook. Our systems achieves the mean Average Precision of 0.844 and 0.749 respectively on these 2 datasets. This shows that our system could be further developed to become a potential utility for online photo sharing services in the future.
