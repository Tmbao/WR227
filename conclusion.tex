\section{Conclusion}

Through our experiments, it is proved that spatial rerank significantly boost the performance of BoW model. This is a very potential result to further improve the performance of many image retrieval systems. In the future, we plan to keep upgrading our system to operate on other datasets which are larger in size and also more variant in term of content. Our final goal is to deploy our system for real-time usage with limited computer resources.
