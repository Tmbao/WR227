\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

As tested our model on Oxford Building Dataset, our implementation of BoW model achieves the mean average precision of 0.844 and is able to retrieve the result in nearly a second. We have also experimented our system on the dataset constructed from different personal photos. Our system has successfully retrieved similar images to a given query and annotate the query with tags similar to those of retrieved images. We believe that our system will help user upload and annotate their personal photos easier than ever before. In the future, we aim to continue to improve the performance of our Visual Instance Search system as well as to build an automatic annotation system that can work on larger scale.
