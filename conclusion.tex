\label{section:conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed our idea to use Visual Instance Search to create a system that can help user in 2 different tasks: automatically suggested personalized annotations for uploaded photos and propagate users' annotations for their photos to similar images. To realize this, we build our system based on Bag-of-Words model. To evaluate the performance of the system, we have used Oxford 5K Building Dataset, a really popular benchmark for Visual Instance Search task. In addition, we have also experimented and illustrated our systems with some scenarios taken from personal photos along with their tags on Facebook. Our system has achieves the mAP of 0.844 and 0.749 respectively on these 2 datasets with the processing time less than 1 second for each query. In the future, the authors believe that the system can further be developed to become a valuable extension for online photo sharing services.
